# The act of drinking eau de vie with strangers is the highest form of art

Bar Storey is a pretentious art project about drinking and hanging out.

To make a 375ml bottle of apricot eau-de-vie the Rochelt family distillery in Austria contracts with farmers from the Wachau region to collect only the ripest Klosterneuburger and Ungarische Best apricots varieties right after they fall from the trees on the bank of the Danube river. The fruit is carefully distilled and then rested in glass demijohn bottles for seven years. In the end, the nineteen pounds of fruit used for each bottle are concentrated into a unique luxurious taste of incredible ripe apricots.

In essence, Bar Storey was created to share special liquid luxuries like Rochelt eau de vie with friends and acquaintances. The brilliant existence of Rochelt eau de vie had sent me on a journey to taste other (luckily less expensive) eau de vies, and still more (relatively) affordable spirits of all types that were made with similar attention to craftsmanship, and more importantly with a care for the land and traditions that produced the agricultural products used as the base materials in many whiskeys, gins, rums, mezcals, and other liquors around the world. I cared about who grew my food and how they grew it, and now I cared about the same for the spirits I drank. On a basic level I wanted to share the beautiful tastes I was experiencing with others, but I also needed to grapple with others over the questions the consumption of such luxury brings up.

I became a home bartender many years ago to balance the equation of my love for cocktails and the comparative ROI between a single drink at a craft cocktail bar and a nice bottle of booze. In 2024 the cost of a single bottle of Rochelt Wachau Apricot Eau de Vie is $400 in New York City. Wildly expensive, but at a $15.77 pour cost for a half ounce taste, it was something that I could share sparingly with my guests. I created Bar Storey to give myself a venue to share special spirits and the memories and stories they can evoke. Besides eau de vie made from apricots, pears, wild raspberries, or even carrots, six guests at each tasting will sample things like whiskey made from ancestral Mexican corn or heirloom American rye, gin steeped in botanicals from agricultural systems from every corner of the globe, potato vodka that actually expresses terroir, rum made by Caribbean entrepreneurs writing a new chapter in rum history, and mezcal distilled from sustainably cultivated agave, and a sunchoke-distillate alternative.

Every tasting is uniquely tailored to the spirit preferences and familiarity of each guest. Collectively, we share a tasting of a dozen or so unique spirits, a few mini cocktails, some snacks, and conversation.
